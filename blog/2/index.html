  <h1>I am not a mystery. I ... </h1>
  <h4>by Dr. Sheshashree Seshadri</h4>
  <h5> Published: 2016-08-06 </h5>
  </div>
  <p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/i-am-not-a-mystery-i-shhh_b_575773afe4b032f018504321">Huffington Post</a>. Dr. Seshadri was working in the border city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Paso,_Texas">El Paso</a> at the time</em></p>
<p>First week into my pediatric practice in the border town of El Paso, I meet a sweet family – a ‘role model veteran’ dad, ‘my-teenage-son-and-me are-buddies’ mom and their son. ‘S’ is a 15 year old, well-mannered MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) kid who wants to be a salesman one day, and says he will advertise and make me ‘popular’ when I start my own clinic in El Paso.</p>
<p>Just when I thought they were my favorite family, they become ‘the dreaded frequent flyers’. The teen has constipation for a week, diarrhea the next, poor appetite, two motor vehicle accidents – just minor injuries but back pain inappropriate to the extent of the injury. Add to this ankle pain from MMA and I suspect a sprain, but guess what? It is a fracture!</p>
<p>“Wait … Where are you falling from and how is that you have these completely dislocated fractures??” I ponder.
Fatigue soon follows the list, and he gets checked for anemia and Vitamin D deficiency. Surprisingly, a majority of kids in this Sun city are Vitamin D Deficient. “How?” I ask my staff, to be told that they have been avoiding the ‘CALL OF DUTY’ from the Sun (read - not playing outside) instead preferring to play ‘MINECRAFT’ video games and becoming ‘Gordo’ as my front desk reminds me.</p>
<p>Next month I see him again with an outbreak of hives. Allergy panel normal, though the allergist contemplates it must be the rusted weights from the gym. Parents are concerned. I do not hear back from him for a month. Just when I go “Phew… Finally!!” but NO… He returns with complaints of more vengeance. This time around, it’s arm weakness, leg tingling and tremors. “Arggh!”</p>
<p>Referral to several specialists followed by CT scan and MRI scan of literally every single body part – all drawing blanks. More hives, not just an allergic reaction but full blown anaphylaxis with swollen lips, trouble breathing, weekly visits to ER. Epi pen, Benadryl, steroids, followed by more complaints of tremors, but tests show a normal thyroid profile. More tests on blood for rare disorders.</p>
<p>He hardly makes eye contact, does not talk much anymore, cannot focus in school and feels embarrassed that he is coming every week to see me or is it the other way round?  Having no answers make me feel terrible and I do not want to look him in the eye. ‘Curbside consult’ with several specialists throws up no answers.</p>
<p>I feel defeated, “What am I missing?”</p>
<p>My front desk reminds me – It has been 64 days since he came. “Is that good news? No news is good news, right?” But knowing him, he is just avoiding coming to see me.</p>
<p>Then one day,I hear his voice at the front desk stating he wants to speak with me. “Oh my Good Lord! He is here by himself- all alone?”
He says “I trust you and I have come to you. I am READY to speak. I am not a mystery.”</p>
<p>“I was sexually abused by my paternal uncle for 3 years” and goes into the gory details. He had had ‘attacks’ during his visits to his grandparent’s house. He had been doing drugs for the last two months and was nervous to make eye contact lest I caught him. He also got into street fights with drug dealers and got beaten up.</p>
<p>I cannot breathe anymore. I collapse into the nearest chair in the room. I did ‘child abuse’ rotation as a resident but where do I start now?
The most dreaded question – “Have you divulged this to your ‘veteran’ dad and mom?”</p>
<p>He, “I want you to mediate”. “Me??”</p>
<p>I set up an 8.00 P.M appointment with his parents all the while preparing myself mentally. I put together all the resources for him and his family by speaking to a lot of people in between my patients. It is 7.30 P.M and they are already here. Dad walks in and says he’s glad I was able to figure out his ‘mystery’ boy. Did he think I had a rare medical diagnosis for him? Is it hypoglycemia or this ‘NEWS’??- I feel dizzy.</p>
<p>Calm and confident, I say “S has something to tell you”. And the conversation goes on for a few hours into the night with me filling in when the kid could not. Dad is howling at the end of it and mom stares at the ground speechless. I am sobbing uncontrollably. Dad announces “Family hug time”. I want to give them their personal space and as I am stepping back, the three pull ME into a tight hug. Amid the tears, dad keeps repeating “My little brother and my son. I will do the right thing”.</p>
<p>Finally after they leave, I start calling CPS, Cops, Referral to Sexual Abuse center, Expressive Center of Arts, Counselling, Psychiatry evaluation, Gastroenterologist for bowel incontinence caused by abuse, STD panel, Drug screen, Family counselling with extra sessions for dad. The ‘attacks’ now explains the constipation vs diarrhea. His drug abuse is the cause for tremors from withdrawal. His “no-show” is due to drug addiction.</p>
<p>They come by to update me that a speedy trial has started. When the dad confronted the accused, he accepted and confirmed it. The kid is in rehab and counselling. The perpetrator has since been imprisoned.</p>
<p>I think of him sometimes during my drive to work or during my missed lunch hours and become misty eyed.</p>
<p>Weeks have gone by. He is back again with a graduation day invite for me! He wants my pearls of wisdom –</p>
<p>“You are a warrior. You are a survivor. You are strong. It is Okay to be weak at times and seek help.”</p>
<p>Now they all shout “FAMILY HUG”, I join them singing and hugging - “<em>WE ARE FAMILY. WE ARE FAMILY</em>.”</p>
<p>I truly love my patients on the border!</p>
